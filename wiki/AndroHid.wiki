#summary A technical documentation.
= Introduction =

Some technical issues of AndroHid will be described here, going into technical details which may not be of any interest for end users.

= Bluetooth and l2cap =

Android SDK does not provide any functionality for the l2cap bluetooth protocol which is required for the bluetooth HID specification. Nevertheless we can handle with the android bluetooth stack _bluez_ directly via the _native development kit_ (NDK). Hence all bluetooth handling is done in native C code working even on android versions previous to 2.0 where for the first time bluetooth functionality was invented in the SDK.
